You need PyPDF2 to run these scripts.

The imposition scripts will prompt you for a number of pages per signature (it will make sure the number of pages in your file is right for the number of pages per signature).

The 2-pages-per-side program allows you to have a last signature with a different number of pages.

The "fold-in-half" program will join the pages of your file together 2 by 2 (not as signatures!). It should be perfect to create tiny books! just make sure you took your file through the 2-page-imposition program first to make the signatures!

If you have any questions / need any help with these, find me in the renegade bindery discord server! (Screen name Nessie) or on [tumblr](https://nessieshirak.tumblr.com).
