You need PyPDF2 to run these scripts.

The scripts will prompt you for a number of pages per signature (make sure the number of pages in your file is right for the number of pages per signature!).

The 2-pages-per-side program allows you to have a last signature with a different number of pages.

If you have any questions / need any help with these, find me in the renegade bindery discord server! (Screen name Nessie) or on [tumblr](https://nessieshirak.tumblr.com).
