A loving pastische/recreation of the modern Penguin Classics cover style in LaTeX. This template should be compiled using Lualatex or Xelatex for the `fontspec` package. Fonts you will need installed are [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville), [Jost](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost), and [Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spartan), all available for free from Google Fonts (optionally, you can skip Spartan and replace it's reference with Jost, but it won't look as nice).
