# Clever Pattern Press

Oophf, so I really like fun imposition and tiny books. My scripts are a fucking mess and I don't play "IT Support" all that well. Am always happy to help (or run things locally on my machine) but not sure if I'm all that good at getting others set up. 

My imposition scripts rely on [pdfjam](https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam) - a command line tool that's great for shuffling PDFs in any which way. 

## QR Code

URLs are often long and my books are small. I like leaning on QR codes for digital information transmition for such things. [**qrcode**monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) is my favorite service.

## Shared Files

- `base_odense.tex` : was shared by Discord user Odense way back when the server started as the base TeX file they used and I've coveted and cherished it since. It's the best example of a good layout I have and all my stuff has been built off of (and clobbered) it

- `mini_book` : resources for my smallest books- both TeX file and a python script (leaning on PDF jam) that lays them out in strips that fold up zig-zag like and make 2 folio/3 folio signatures
